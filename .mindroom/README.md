# MindRoom Fork Docs

This directory documents the fork-specific changes in `mindroom-ai/mindroom-librechat` that are not part of upstream `danny-avila/LibreChat`.

Goal:
- explain why each fork feature exists
- explain what behavior it adds
- keep upstream sync/rebase easier by making fork deltas explicit

## Provenance

- Keep detailed provenance in each feature doc (`Fork PR`, `Upstream PR` when applicable).

## Maintenance

- When adding or changing a fork-specific feature, update the relevant doc in this directory in the same PR.
- When a feature is ported from upstream, add/update explicit `Fork PR` and `Upstream PR` links in that feature doc.
